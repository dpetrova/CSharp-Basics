C# and .NET Differences

.NET is a blanket term that tends to cover both the .NET Framework (an application framework library) and the Common Language Runtime which is the runtime for executing applications.
C# is a programming language and the knowledge of C# implies some knowledge of .NET because the C# object model corresponds to the .NET object model. Microsoft's implementation of C# is heavily integrated with the .NET Framework so it is understandable that the two concepts would be confused. However it is important to understand that they are two very different things.
