    //Do you know that the next solar eclipse will occur on April 29, 2014? It will be observable from South Asia, Australia,
    //the Pacific and the Indian Oceans and Antarctica. Spiro is an entrepreneur who wants to cash in on this natural phenomenon.
    //Help him produce protective sunglasses of different sizes. You will get 5% of the profit.
    //Input
    //•	The input data should be read from the console.
    //•	You have an integer number N (always an odd number) specifying the height of sunglasses.
    //The input data will always be valid and in the format described. There is no need to check it explicitly.
    //Output
    //The output should be printed on the console.
    //You should print the sunglasses on the console. The sunglasses consist of three parts: frames, lenses and a bridge
    //(the connection between the two frames). Each frame's width is double the height N and should be printed using 
    //the character '*' (asterisk). Print the lenses with the character '/'. Finally, connect the two frames with a bridge
    //that is of size N, using the character '|'. Leave the rest of the space between the frames blank.
    //Constraints
    //•	The number N will be a positive odd integer number in range [3…101].
    //•	Allowed working time for your program: 0.25 seconds.
    //•	Allowed memory: 16 MB.
