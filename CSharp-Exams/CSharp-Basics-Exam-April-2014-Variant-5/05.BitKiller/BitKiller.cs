    //from the leftmost to the rightmost. Bits are numbered starting from 0.
    //Input
    //•	The input data should be read from the console.
    //•	The number n stays at the first line.
    //•	The number step stays at the second line.
    //•	At each of the next n lines n bytes are given, each at a separate line. 
    //The input data will always be valid and in the format described. There is no need to check it explicitly.
    //Output
    //The output should be printed on the console. Print the output bytes, each at a separate line.
    //Constraints
    //•	The number n will be an integer number in the range [1…100].
    //•	The number step will be an integer number in the range [1…20].
    //•	The n numbers will be integers in the range [0…255].
    //•	Allowed working time for your program: 0.25 seconds.
    //•	Allowed memory: 16 MB.
