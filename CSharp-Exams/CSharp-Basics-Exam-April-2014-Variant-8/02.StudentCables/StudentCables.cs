    //Once at the Software University (SoftUni) we had problems with the Wi-Fi network. It was working well in the previous
    //days even with a few hundred students browsing Internet in the same time, but at the exam all the students came with
    //their laptop at fixed time and tried to establish a wireless connection simultaneously. This flooded the Wi-Fi access
    //points and as a result some of the students were unable to get an IP address from the DHCP server. They of course
    //established a Wi-Fi Internet connection after a few reconnects in next 5-10 minutes, but were highly stressed because
    //they didn't had Internet immediately before the start the exam start.
    //Nakov, the main driver of SoftUni, decided to solve the problem by connecting some of the students through a standard
    //network cables. He installed a few network switches in the exam lab and started to prepare cables for the students. 
    //His idea was to use 5 meters long cables (called student cables) between the switches and the student's laptops. Nakov 
    //wanted to create as much as possible cables of size 5 meters. He had a lot of cables of different sizes, e.g. a big roll
    //of 300 meters, another big roll of 130 meters and a few small cables of 30 cm, 15 cm and 10 cm. The cables had different
    //sizes and was measured in different measures (meters or centimeters). Nakov calculated that he needed 2 cm for 
    //crimping each RJ45 connector and 3 cm for joining each two pieces of cable. It was complex to calculate how much cables
    //Nakov can create so he needs your help.
    //Write a program that takes as an input a sequence of N cables of different sizes and calculates how many student cables
    //Nakov can create by first joining them all together, then cut them into 5 meters and 4 cm, and finally crimp the RJ45 
    //connectors to obtain 5 meters long student network cables. Calculate also the length of the unused remaining cable. 
    //Note that cables shorter than 20 cm in the input will be thrown away, so please discard therm.
    //Input
    //The input data should be read from the console.
    //•	At the first line an integer number n specifying the number of cables will be given.
    //•	At the next 2 * n lines the cables will be given: first comes the cable length; second comes the measure.
    //The input data will always be valid and in the format described. There is no need to check it explicitly.
    //Output
    //The output should be printed on the console. It should consist of exactly 2 lines:
    //•	The first line should hold the number of student cables.
    //•	The second line should hold the length of the remaining cable.
    //Constraints
    //•	The number n will be integer in the range [1 … 100].
    //•	The cable length is integer in the range [1 … 500].
    //•	The cable measure is one of the following values: meters, centimeters.
    //•	Allowed working time for your program: 0.1 seconds. Allowed memory: 16 MB.
