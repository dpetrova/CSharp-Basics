class JumpingSums
{
    //You are given a string S consisting of N numbers. Each of them have indexes ranging from 0 to N-1 and a value (integer
    //number). You are also given a number J which represents the number of jumps to be made. Each of the numbers jumps J times
    //to the right. Your task is to find all sums after each of the numbers has made its J jumps. The value of the number and
    //the current index show the next index that we have to jump to (e.g. index = 3, value = 4, nextIndex = 3+4 =7). 
    //Example: if S = “2 1 2” and J=2. The first number “2” (index0) (sum1 += 2) should jump 2 positions to the right, 
    //so it jumps to the last number (index2). This index holds value 2 (sum1 += 2), so it jumps 2 indexes to the right. 
    //In this case, we don’t have enough indexes to the right so we restart from the beginning and the jump will land on index1
    //(sum1 += 1, sum1 = 5). For the second sum we start from the second position (index1, sum2 += 1). The next index is 1 
    //position on the right (index2, sum2 += 2). The next position is 2 positions on the right with restart from the beginning
    //(index1, sum2 += 1). Finally sum2 = 4. We repeat that process for every number in S. Your task is to find the biggest sum
    //after every number has made enough jumps.
    //Input
    //The input data should be read from the console. It consists of 2 lines:
    //•	At the first line you will be given string S holding integer numbers separated by a single space.
    //•	At the second line you will be given integer J representing the number of jumps each number should make.
    //The input data will always be valid and in the format described. There is no need to check it explicitly.
    //Output
    //The output should be printed on the console. It should consist of exactly 1 line:
    //•	On the first line print the maximal sum in the format “max sum = {0}”.
    //Constraints
    //•	The string S will hold maximum of 100 numbers in the range [0…1000]
    //•	The J input  value will be an integer in the range [1…10000]
    //•	Allowed working time: 0.2 seconds. Allowed memory: 16 MB.
