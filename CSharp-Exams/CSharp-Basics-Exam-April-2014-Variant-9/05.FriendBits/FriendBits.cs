{
    //"Friend bits" are sequences of bits with the same value. All other bits are "alone bits". For example in the sequence
    //11101010011011010000111010110001 the friend bits (marked in grey, from left to right) are:
    //111, 00, 11, 11, 0000, 111, 11 and 000. In the same sequence alone bits are: 0101, 0, 01, 010 and 1.
    //We are given a 32-bit integer n. Write a program that extracts all friend bits and all alone bits from n. Append all friend bits in the same order in which they appear in n and print their decimal representation f. Respectively, append all alone bits in the order in which they appear in n and print their decimal representation a.
    //Input
    //The input data should be read from the console. It holds the number n at the first line.
    //The input data will always be valid and in the format described. There is no need to check it explicitly.
    //Output
    //The output should be printed on the console. It should consist of exactly 2 lines: the numbers f and a.
    //Constraints
    //•	All input and output numbers should be unsigned 32-bit integers in the range [0 to 4 294 967 295].
    //•	Time limit: 0.1 seconds.
    //•	Memory limit: 16 MB.
