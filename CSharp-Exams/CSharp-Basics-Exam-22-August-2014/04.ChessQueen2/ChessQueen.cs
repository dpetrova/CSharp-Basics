{
    //We are given a chess board of size N * N. The only figures we have on the chess board are two queens. The queen in
    //chess can move in horizontal, vertical and diagonal directions. We are also given a number D which represents the
    //distance between the two queens. The distance is measured by D squares away. All positions on the chessboard are
    //represented with numbers and letters (a1, a2… a8, b1-b8, c1-c8, …, h1-h8). Example: if N=16, the numbers on the
    //board will be represented with integers (1-16) and letters (a-o). Your task is to find all couples of queens where
    //the queens stay either on the same vertical, horizontal or diagonal, at distance D. 
    //Input
    //The input data should be read from the console. It consists of 2 lines:
    //•	The first line holds an integer number N representing the width and height of the chess board.
    //•	The second line holds an integer number D representing the distance that we should be looking for.
    //The input data will always be valid and in the format described. There is no need to check it explicitly.
    //Output
    //The output should be printed on the console as a sequence of chess position in the format
    //[quеen1X, quеen1Y  - quеen2X, quеen2Y]. The order of the output is not important. Each string should stay on a 
    //separate line. In case they are no valid positions print “No valid position”.
    //Constraints
    //•	The numbers N and D will be integers in the range [0…20].
    //•	Allowed memory: 16 MB.
