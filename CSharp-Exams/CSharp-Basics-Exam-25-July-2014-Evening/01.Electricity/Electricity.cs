    //In the "Students Town" each flat in the dorms has 8 lamps, each consuming 100.53 Watts (2 in the kitchen, 3 in the 
    //living-room, 1 in the bathroom, 1 in the bedroom and 1 in the lumber-room). Additionally each flat has 8 computers, 
    //each consuming 125.90 Watts (1 in the kitchen, 2 in the living-room, 1 in the bathroom, 3 in the bedroom and 1 in the 
    //lumber-room). The lamps and computers in each flat always operate in a strict schedule every day:
    //•	From 14:00 to 18:59 -> 2 lamps + 2 computers are running
    //•	From 19:00 to 23:59 -> 7 lamps + 6 computers are running
    //•	From 00:00 to 08:59 -> 1 lamp + 8 computers are running
    //Write a program to calculate how many Watts is the total power consumption of the dorms at given time of the day. You will
    //be given the number of floors in the dorms and the number of flats at each floor that operate in the specified time.
    //Input
    //The input data should be read from the console. It consists of exactly 3 lines:
    //•	The first line holds the number of floors – floors.
    //•	The second line holds the number of flats at each floor – flats.
    //•	The third line holds the time of the day in format hh:mm – time.
    //The input data will always be valid and in the format described. There is no need to check it explicitly.
    //Output
    //Print at the console the total power consumption in format "X Watts" where X is the total power consumption. Truncate down the result to the nearest whole number.
    //Constraints
    //•	The number floors is a positive integer in the range [1…30].
    //•	The number flats is a positive integer in the range [1…222].
    //•	The hours hh is a positive integer in the range [0…23]. It might have a leading zero, e.g. "09".
    //•	The minutes mm is a positive integer in the range [0…59]. It might have a leading zero, e.g. "00".
    //•	Allowed working time for your program: 0.25 seconds.
    //•	Allowed memory: 16 MB.
